Linux Mint Desktop Theme in Wine/Red colors
Includes Borders, Controls, as well as the Desktop menu & panel etc.

This theme has larger fonts and spacing.  I adapted it for my new laptop that jumped my resolution from 1366x768 to 1920x1080.   It was a shock and I needed a bit more help.

This has been tested on Mint 20. It will work on 19 but the margin in cinnamon.css needs to be adjusted if it crowds the panel.

.menu-selected-app-box {
    margin: 5px 0px 15px 0px;   /* change the 3rd number from 0px to 10 or more px */
